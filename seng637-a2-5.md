# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we performed unit testing on the Range class and DataUtilities from the JFreeChart library. The Range class encapsulates a range of numeric values and provides several methods to query whether a value is contained within the range, calculate the length of the range, and determine the central value, upper, and lower bounds.

Additionally, we tested the DataUtilities class, which provides utility methods for managing and manipulating datasets in JFreeChart. Both classes are integral to handling numerical data and performing various range-based operations.

The primary objective of this testing was to ensure the correctness of the methods in both classes through Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) and Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP). These methods were tested to confirm that each function behaves as expected across a variety of test cases, ensuring reliable and accurate functionality for data manipulation and range operations.
