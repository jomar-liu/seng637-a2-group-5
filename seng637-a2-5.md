# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we performed unit testing on the Range class from the JFreeChart library. The Range class encapsulates a range of numeric values and provides methods to query whether a value is contained within the range, to calculate the length of the range, and to find the central value, upper, and lower bounds. 

The primary objective of the testing was to ensure the correctness of these methods through Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) and Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP), ensuring that each function behaves as expected across a variety of test cases.
